# url2QR
This script converts input URL into a binary encoded QR code. 
It also installs pyqrcode and pypng using pip commands  which are required for this process. 

Output : You will get a my_QR.png file as an output stored at C:\temp2

Dont worry if you dont have that directory, this code will create one for you :) 

Happy Converting..!
